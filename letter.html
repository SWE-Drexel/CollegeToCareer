                	<p> <i> Retrieved from: https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-write-a-cover-letter-31-tips-you-need-to-know </i> </p>
			<ol>
			<li> Don&rsquo;t Regurgitate Your Resume: Describe the details you were not able to discuss in the resume. and expand on the resume points by describing what makes you a perfect fit for the position and company. </li>
			<li>Think Not What the Company Can Do for You: Hiring managers want to know what you would bring to the position and company. </li>
			<li>Clearly Show What You&rsquo;re Capable Of: Along with explaining your past experiences, describe what you can do in the future. &quot;Determine the key requirements and priorities for this job, and make it instantly clear to the reviewer that you can deliver the goods on these key things,&quot; says Jenny Foss, job search expert and founder of JobJenny.com. </li>
			<li>Showcase Your Skills: When you know you have the potential to do the job&mdash;but your past experience doesn&rsquo;t totally sell you&mdash;try focusing on your skills, instead. </li>
			<li>Not Necessarily Your Education: what hiring managers care about most is your work experience (and yes, that can be volunteer or internship experience, too) &mdash;and what you can walk through the door and deliver on Day 1. </li>
			<li>Don&rsquo;t Apologize for Skills You Don&rsquo;t Have: Avoid phrases such as, &quot;Despite my limited experience with...&quot; or &quot;While I only have work experience doing administrative tasks...&quot; focus on the skills you do have, says career expert Lily Zhang. &quot;Stay positive, focus on your strengths, and immediately launch into your transferable skills and infectious enthusiasm for the position.&quot; </li>
			<li>Highlight the Right Experiences: Drop the text of the job description into a word cloud tool like Wordle, and see what stands out. That&rsquo;s what the hiring manager is looking for most, so feature emphasize those in cover letter. </li>
			<li>Tell a Story: What brings you to this company? Stories bring your background and experiences to life; keep them short and to the point.) </li>
			<li>Use a Few Numbers: When it comes to the job search, numbers often speak louder than words. &quot;Offer stats to illustrate your impact on companies or associations you&rsquo;ve worked for in the past,&quot; suggests career expert and founder of ProfessionGal Megan Broussard. </li>
			<li>Consider Testimonials: If you have great feedback from old co-workers, bosses, or clients, don&rsquo;t be afraid to use it! Integrate a positive quote from a previous manager or client by using it as evidence of your passion for your area of expertise. </li>
			<li>Cut the Formality: &quot;Don&rsquo;t be overly formal (&rsquo;I wish to convey my interest in filling the open position at your fine establishment&rsquo;),&quot; writes career expert Mark Slack. Show the friendly, approachable, and awesome-to-work-with person you are. </li>
			<li>Think Custom, Not Canned: Most companies want to see that you&rsquo;re truly excited about the position and company, which means creating a custom letter for each position you apply for. </li>
			<li>Start With a Template: Include your passion and reason for working in that position, and a few relevant experiences that helped you develop some key skills that you can contribute to this job. </li>
			<li>Or Some Inspiration: Having trouble getting started? Search online for successful cover letter examples, and reach out to your peers/mentors with experience in the field for inputs on how to start. </li>
			<li>Be Open to Other Formats: If you&rsquo;re applying to a more traditional company, then the three-to-five-paragraph format probably makes sense. However, if you&rsquo;re gunning for a more creative or startup job&mdash;or need to explain to the hiring manager, say, how your career has taken you from teaching to business development, a different approach could be appropriate. </li>
			<li>But Don&rsquo;t Go Too Far: Always stay professional. </li>
			<li>Consider Adding a Headline: One formatting idea from The Undercover Recruiter? Add an eye-catching headline to your letter, like &quot;3 Reasons I&rsquo;m an Excellent Fit for the Marketing Manager Position.&quot; This can be an easy way to catch the hiring manager&rsquo;s eye quickly. </li>
			<li>Be Real: Always write with honesty and integrity. Reflecting a genuine interest pays off more than simply following career guides. &quot;Honest, genuine writing always goes much, much further than sticking to every dumb rule you&rsquo;ve ever read in stale, outdated career guides and college textbooks,&quot; explains Foss. </li>
			<li>...And Normal: Downplay the adverbs a bit, and just write like a normal person. </li>
			<li>Cut the Fluff: show off your skills with descriptive statements like &rsquo;I&rsquo;m an expert communicator with experience bringing together diverse departments to develop a cohesive program.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s longer&mdash;but it&rsquo;s also stronger.&quot; </li>
			<li>Write in the Company&rsquo;s &quot;Voice&quot;: Cover letters are a great way to show that you understand the environment and culture of the company and industry and prove that you&rsquo;ve got what they are looking for. Spending five or 10 minutes reading over the company website before you get started can be a great way to get in the right mindset&mdash;you&rsquo;ll get a sense for the company&rsquo;s tone, language, and culture, which are all things you&rsquo;ll want to mirror as you&rsquo;re writing. </li>
			<li>Boost Your Confidence Before Writing: Writing guru Alexandra Franzen offers a simple mind trick that will dramatically change the way you write cover letters: Pretend. &quot;Pretend that the person you&rsquo;re writing to already loves and respects you. Pretend that the person you&rsquo;re writing to already believes that you&rsquo;re worthy and valuable. Pretend that the person you&rsquo;re writing to doesn&rsquo;t need a big sales pitch,&quot; she explains. Then, write. Your words will come out so much easier. </li>
			<li>Have Some Fun With It: Hoping for a job at a startup? Making your cover letter more creative&mdash;whether you play with the format, or make it more visual&mdash;will likely improve your chances of getting a call back. Applying for a corporate position? Stick with the traditional format, but make it more conversational, or include a story about how you first came in contact with the company or how much you love it. </li>
			<li>Don&rsquo;t Let Your Fear of Bragging Get in the Way: If you tend to have a hard time writing about yourself, here&rsquo;s a quick trick: Imagine you&rsquo;re someone else writing a letter about yourself. Think from the perspective of a friend, mentor, or previous employer&mdash;someone who would only sing your praises&mdash;and then write the letter from her point of view. </li>
			<li>Have Someone Gut Check It: Have a friend take a look at your cover letter, and ask questions: Does this sell me as the best person for the job? and Does it get you excited? If the answer to either is &quot;no,&quot; or even slight hesitation, go back for another pass. </li>
			<li>Keep it Short and Sweet: don&rsquo;t go over a page. </li>
			<li>Don&rsquo;t Start With Your Name: Get right to the point with what you can bring to the job. </li>
			<li>But Do Include the Hiring Manager&rsquo;s Name: Use the person&rsquo;s first and last name, including a &quot;Mr.&quot; or &quot;Ms.&quot; (e.g., Mr. Jack Smith). Never use &quot;To Whom it May Concern&quot; or &quot;Dear or Sir or Madam&quot;. </li>
			<li>Unless You Don&rsquo;t Know It: If you can only find a list of executives and you&rsquo;re not completely confident who the hiring manager is, use the head of the department for the position you&rsquo;re applying for. If you really don&rsquo;t have a name to use, try to still be as specific as possible in your greeting. Consider using &quot;Senior Analyst Hiring Manager&quot; or &quot;Research Manager Search Committee&quot;&mdash;something that shows that you&rsquo;ve written this letter with a particular audience in mind. </li>
			<li>Edit: Run your cover letter through spell-check, and Check out how the wording sounds to others using Hemingway. Drop your text onto the page, and the color-coded app will give your writing a once-over. Is a sentence too wordy, overly complex, or totally unreadable? It&rsquo;ll be highlighted in red until you revise it. Tend to overuse the passive voice? Every instance of it will show up in green. The site will even recommend when you can use shorter or simpler words. </li>
			<li>But Care Most About Standing Out: Perhaps the best piece of cover letter wisdom we can offer you comes from Foss:. Be memorable. Nail the stuff that will make you a true standout.&quot; </li>
