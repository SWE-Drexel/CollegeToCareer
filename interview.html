                                        <h3>Sample Questions</h3>
                                        Here are some sample questions and tips associated with them
                                        that can you help you prepare.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li> Why should I hire you?</li>
                                            This can be one of the most challenging to easy questions depending
                                            on the job. The main key here is to make yourself look unique and 
                                            highlight points(soft skills or hard skills) that you sets you apart!
                                            <li> Do you have any questions for us?</li>
                                            Believe it or not, companies do care about this question. 
                                            This is not only a way for them to assess your interest but 
                                            also understand your thinking process and your priorities in
                                            a work place.
                                            <li> Where else are you interviewing? </li>
                                            While not the most common one, when asked this can get 
                                            tricky as there is no way to predict where your answer 
                                            might lead. The best option would be to stay prepared.
                                            
                                            <li> Give an example of a time when you didn't have enough 
                                                information to do you job? What steps do you take?</li>
                                            While thise question might seem to specific, 
                                            these type questions are mainly situational based. It is always
                                            good to have a few examples in general at the back of your mind
                                            and mold it the question like in this case. 
                                        </ul>
