        	<h3> 27 Things that Should Not be on your Resume </h3>
			<p> <i> Retrieved from: https://www.themuse.com/advice/45-thing-you-might-have-on-your-resume-that-need-to-be-removed </i> </p>
		
			<ol>
			<b>Formatting</b>

			<li> A Career Objective: This is obvious when submitting the resume. Instead, save space and make it clear why you&rsquo;re so interested in each specific position you&rsquo';re applying to in your cover letter. </li>
			<li> A Skills-Based Format: Stick with the good old reverse chronological (where your most recent experience is listed first) in almost every occasion. If your most recent experience isn&rsquo;t what you want to highlight or you&rsquo;re re-entering the workforce after a long hiatus, top your resume with an &quot;Executive Summary&quot; section that outlines your best skills and accomplishments, or create two experience sections: One specific one, such as &quot;Business Development Experience&quot; or &quot;Editorial Experience,&quot; followed by a more general one. </li>
			<li> Photos or Other Visuals: &quot;such visual elements reduced recruiters&rsquo; analytical capability and hampered decision-making&quot; and kept them from &quot;locating the most relevant information, like skills and experience.&quot; </li>
			<li> Mega Blocks of Text: recruiters look at resumes pretty quickly&mdash;a minute at best, the blink of an eye at worst&mdash;so make yours as easy to skim as possible. Keep your text short and sweet, and in bullet points, not block text. </li>
			<li> A Second Page: If you have less than 10 years of experience, having more than one page can be a deal-breaker for some recruiters. With a little formatting prowess, we promise you can get it down to one page. </li>
			<li> All Those Fonts: Stick with one&mdash;maybe two, if you have some design skills. Don&rsquo;t risk it with distractions. </li>
			<li> Orphan Words: (They&rsquo;re those single words left on a line by themselves.) Instead, see edit the previous line so they can fit&mdash;making your resume look cleaner and opening up extra lines for you to fill with other things. </li>
			<li> &quot;References Available Upon Request:&quot; At worst, it makes you look presumptuous, and even at best, you can use the extra space to add a detail about your abilities or accomplishments. </li>
			<br/>

			<b>Personal Details</b>

			<li> Your Address: If you&rsquo;re not local, recruiters might not look any further. And if you are? Recruiters may take your commute time into account and turn you down if they think it would be too long, explains AvidCareerist. </li>
 			<li> Your Work Email Address:  Do you really want your future employer to know that you&rsquo;re job searching on your employer boss&rsquo; time and email server? </li>
			<li> Your &quot;Creative&quot; Email Address:  &quot;I can&rsquo;t actually share any here without giving away someone&rsquo;s personal contact info,&quot; says Ryan Galloway of The Hired Guns. &quot;I will say, however, that if you&rsquo;re a grown person applying for a Director of Marketing gig, the word &quot;Belieber&quot; has no place in your email address.&quot; </li>
			<li> Your &quot;Creative&quot; Hobbies: &quot;Unless you are applying for jobs that will specifically value these interests (or they&rsquo;re flat-out amazing conversation starters), leave them off. Decision makers will judge the heck out of you if they spot hobbies that fly in the face of their own personal beliefs or seem odd.&quot; - JobJenny</li>
			<li> Your Birthdate, Marital Status, or Religion: Since it&rsquo;s illegal for employers to consider this when looking at your application (at least in the U.S.), they can&rsquo;t request it (and offering it makes you look a little clueless). </li>
			<br/>

			<b>Work Experience and Education</b>

			<li> A Regurgitation of Your Job Description: Include less about what you did day-to-day (like answer phones and email) did and more about what you accomplished over time (like increased customer satisfaction 20%).  </li>
			<li> Bullet #8: As a rule, stick to just 6-7 bullets for each section&mdash;the recruiters mostly won&rsquo;t get through them all. </li>
			<li> Positions Irrelevant to Your Current Job Goals: Unless you need it to fill a gap on your resume or showcase your skills, there&rsquo;s no law that says you have to include your six months at Burger Shack on your resume. </li>
			<li>&quot;Unpaid:&quot; No need to state if your co-op was paid or not. If you got great experience, let that stand on its own. </li>
			<li> Your Parenting Experience: If you took time out of the workforce to raise kids, don&rsquo;t list your parenting experience on your resume. Most corporate decision makers aren&rsquo;t going to take this section seriously - Foss </li>
			<li> Anything High School-Related: Unless you&rsquo;re a year out of college, really need to bulk up your resume, and did something highly relevant (and awesome) during your high school years, no need to include it on your resume. </li>
			<li>Skills That Everyone Has (or Should): Think Microsoft Word and &quot;the internet.&quot; </li>
			<br/>

			<b>Specific Words</b>

			<li>Unnecessarily Big Words: Why &quot;utilize&quot; when you can &quot;use?&quot; especially when the former takes up more space on your resume. &quot;Run the &rsquo;would I ever say this in real life?&rsquo; test on every phrase/sentence in your resume,&quot; says Foss. &quot;If you find words or statements that don&rsquo;t read like something you&rsquo;d say? Change &rsquo;em up.&quot; </li>
			<li>Industry Jargon or Buzzwords: Make sure everything you include is understandable to the average person. </li>
			<li>Words with a Negative Connotation: Even if you mean them in a positive way, like &quot;met aggressive sales goals,&quot; research has shown that words like problem, mistake, and fault can have a negative impact on a recruiter&rsquo;s perception of you. </li>
			<li>Vague Terms:  (Think professional, experienced, and people person.) They&rsquo;re chronically overused, find other describers. </li>
			<li>Any of the Words in CareerBuilder&rsquo;s Survey of Resume Words Recruiters Hate: Seriously, why annoy them right out of the gate? The list is topped with &quot;Best of breed,&quot; and followed by: Go-getter, Think Outside of the Box, Synergy, Go-to Person, Thought Leadership, Value Add, Results Driven, Team Player, Bottom Line, Hard Worker, Strategic Thinker, Dynamic, Self-Motivated, Detail-oriented, Proactively, Track Record </li>
			<li>Typos: But don&rsquo;t rely on spell check and grammar check alone&mdash;ask family or friends to take a look at it for you (or get some tips on how to edit your own work). </li>
			<li>Anything that&rsquo;s Not True: Just, don&rsquo;t. If you&rsquo;re not sure you have the experience to qualify for your dream gig, don&rsquo;t manufacture it&mdash;go look for ways to get it. </li>
